=============

This is an OMERO.web plugin (Django app) that provides a 'gallery' view of images in OMERO, ideal for public browsing without editing.

OMERO.gallery overview
======================

This application is designed to support browsing of images via the hierarchy of
Group > Project > Dataset > Image.

Public access can be enabled [as described here]
(http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/support/omero5/developers/Web/PublicData.html), otherwise
users will see the standard web login screen.

The home page will display all the available groups that the user can access, with a random
thumbnail from each group. The number of Projects, Datasets and Images within each group
will also be displayed.

On browsing into a group, the Projects and 'orphaned' Datasets will be shown in a similar layout.

Projects are shown with 5 thumbnails from each Dataset. Clicking 'All Images' will load all the remaining thumbnails
from a chosen Dataset (or you can browse to the Dataset itself by clicking the Dataset name link).

Clicking a thumbnail will take you directly to the full image viewer.
